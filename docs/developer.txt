Notes for MartExplorer developers
=================================

Ant (Build tool)
----------------

The build program used is called ant. This is used for compiling code,
javadoc documentation, ant creating MartExplorer distribution
files. Running "ant -projecthelp" in the same directory as build.xml
(the build file) will produce a list of currently supported "targets"
or actions. To run one these just type "ant TARGET" e.g. "ant
compile", "ant clean", "ant api", "ant dist" ant "ant test". 

If you don't have ant then you need to install it. You can download it
from http://ant.apache.org.

Ant needs some extra jars to handle our build file. You can include
them in your classpath or more simply copy them to $ANT_HOME/lib or
your JVMs /ext directory. The extra jars are included in ./lib:

  - optional.jar
  - junit.jar
  - xalan.jar



SQL Logging
-----------

SQL logging works by wrapping a "logger" around the real jdbc driver.
By default the results are sent to "spy.log" in the present working directory. 

In order to use it you must tell the applications to use the 
"com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver" driver rather than the "real" one. 
In MartExplorer this is the "Database Driver" 
parameter in the "Add Database" dialog. In MartShell this is the "jdbc driver"
setting while adding a mart. 

The file "../spy.properties" contains the real driver name. If you 
are not using mysql then you should edit this file (it contains 
documentation). You can also redirect the output to a file other than 
"../spy.log" and what is logged.

Example jdbc drivers:
com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver - sql logging
com.mysql.jdbc.Driver - standard mysql driver
