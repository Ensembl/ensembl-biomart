It is possible to get Readline working with MartShell on Mac OS X.
First you have to get readline.  It may work out of the box once
readline is installed using the DarwinPort method mentioned below.

The following instructions were collated from these websites:

A. Install DarwinPorts on your system. This requires admin rights, the
presence of the Developer tools, which on OS X 10.3 is called Xcode tools
(eg., gcc, autoconf, etc), and cvs.  If you already have this installed 
(try running:
 
shell>port
     or
shell>/opt/local/bin/port

 ) 
you can skip step A.

shell>cd ~/
shell>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.opendarwin.org:/Volumes/src/cvs/od login
(hit return for the password, it is blank)
shell>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.opendarwin.org:/Volumes/src/cvs/od co -P darwinports
shell>cd ~/darwinports/base
shell>./configure
shell>make
shell>sudo make install

B. Install readline using DarwinPorts:

shell>port install readline

   or (if the ports binary directory isnt in your path)

shell>/opt/local/bin/port install readline

C. Try out MartShell.sh.  It comes with a precompiled
version of JavaReadline which may work once readline is
installed.  If not, go to section D.

D. Install JavaReadline. 

 1. Download the latest version of libJavaReadline
 from the website:

http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/

 2. untar the downloaded file (if you are using a later
 version than 0.8.0, your filename will reflect this):

shell>tar -zxvf libreadline-java-0.8.0-src.tar.gz

 3. Go into the resulting libreadline-java-X.X.X directory (change
 X to fit the version you downloaded):

shell>cd libreadline-java-0.8.0

 4. Edit two MakeFile files (using vi, vim, pico, or emacs):

shell>emacs Makefile

 and make the following changes:

    * Add
      JAVA_HOME = /Library/Java/Home
      below the line
      # Operating system dependent
    * Make the JAVANATINC variable read $(JAVA_HOME)/include
    * Change LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

shell>emacs src/native/Makefile 

  and change the following:

    * Add -I/opt/local/include to the end of the INCLUDES variable.
    * Change the LIBPATH variable to be -L/usr/lib -L/opt/local/lib
    * Change the CFLAGS variable to -fno-common
    * Change
      $(CC) -shared $(OBJECTS) $(LIBPATH) $($(TG)_LIBS) -o $@
      to
      $(CC) -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress $(OBJECTS) $(LIBPATH) $($(TG)_LIBS) -o $@

  5. Make the required files:

shell>make
shell>ls -l

  If you dont have the files libreadline-java.jar and libJavaReadline.so
  after this has run, something went wrong.

  6. Copy the resulting files to the MartJ lib directory
  (assuming MartJ-0.2 is in your home directory, change to fit your situation):

shell>cp libreadline.jar ~/martj-0.2/lib
shell>cp libJavaReadline.so ~/martj-0.2/lib/macosx/libJavaReadline.jnilib
(note, this involves a copy with a name change, which is important).

You should now be able to run MartShell with readline support.
