/**
 * This simple class wraps a thread, and displays an hourglass for as long as
 * that thread is running. It is synchronised so that if multiple threads are
 * running, only the first one will start the hourglass, and only the last one
 * to end will stop it.
 * <p>
 * The hourglass portion of the thread is run using
 * {@link SwingUtilities#invokeLater(java.lang.Runnable)}, so that it is
 * thread-safe for Swing and can safely work with the GUI. Any parts of the
 * process passed in that work with the GUI must also use this construct to
 * avoid concurrent modification problems.
