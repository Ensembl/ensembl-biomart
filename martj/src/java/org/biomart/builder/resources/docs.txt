MartBuilder is a powerful tool for transforming relational 
databases into denormalised marts. It is part of the BioMart
suite of software tools.

Full documentation is available on the BioMart website at:

  http://www.biomart.org/
  
The main concepts in MartBuilder are:

  Mart - a collection of schemas and datasets built from 
     those schemas.
  
  Schema - a representation of a real database somewhere.
  
  Dataset - a representation of the transformation process 
     applied to one or more schemas to denormalise them.
  
  Main table - the main table of a dataset is the focal point
     of that dataset and contains the most useful info.
     
  Dimension table - extra info about records in the main table
     which is not best included in the main table.
     
  Subclass table - an extension of a main table with extra
     columns.
     
  Partition table - a source of data to use when dividing up
     datasets or dimension tables into smaller related units.
     
Essentially the process of transformation goes like this:

  1. Create a new, blank, mart.
  2. Add your schema to it.
  3. Locate the table you wish to be the central focal point
      of your transformed data.
  4. Right-click that table and choose Create Datasets and hit
      the OK button.
  5. Your dataset is now designed and shown on screen.
  6. Use the Save SQL menu option to generate SQL to build
      that dataset.
      
A tool is provided for automatically running the generated SQL 
and monitoring its progress. That tool is called MartRunner.

Full documentation of MartBuilder and MartRunner can be found
along with documentation for all the rest of the BioMart 
software tools on the BioMart website, as mentioned above.
