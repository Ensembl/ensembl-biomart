<p>This package contains the generic data structures required for
MartBuilder to represent source database schemas and transform them into
Marts.</p>
<p>The central part of the model is the {@link Mart}, which brings
together one or more {@link Schema} objects which provide {@link Table}s
to work with. The {@link Table}s each have a number of {@link Column}s,
{@link Key}s, and can store {@link Relation}s between {@link
PrimaryKey}s or {@link ForeignKey}s.</p>
<p>{@link Schema}s do the work of creating all the {@link Table}s
and related objects by querying a database or other data source. These
{@link Schema}s know exactly how their data source works.</p>
<p>If the {@link Schema} gets the {@link Key}s or {@link Relation}s
wrong, the user can edit them.</p>
<p>Users select the interesting parts of the {@link Mart} by
creating one or more {@link DataSet}s, each focused on a single {@link
Table} which will translate ultimately to the main table of the dataset.
Within the {@link DataSet}, uninteresting {@link Column}s and {@link
Relation}s can be masked out. If all the {@link Relation}s between a
{@link Table} and another {@link Table} connected to the central main
table are masked out, then that {@link Table} is masked out as well.
Masking a {@link Column} that is part of a {@link Key} will mask out all
{@link Relation}s using that {@link Key} as well.</p>
<p>The {@link DataSet} is generated by walking over the graph
represented by the {@link Key}s (nodes) and unmasked {@link Relation}s
(edges). A list of {@link Relation}s required to join together a number
of {@link Table}s is all that is required to define a {@link
DataSetTable}, as the {@link Column}s to include can be inferred by
following the {@link Relation}s and checking for masked ones in the
{@link DataSet}.</p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is the {@link MartConstructor}.
Like the {@link Schema} it is data source aware. The {@link
MartConstructor} takes a {@link DataSet} and generates the final mart
based on the definitions found in that {@link DataSet}. How it does this
is data source specific, and also depends on the compatibility of the
various {@link Schema}s providing the data to be put into the mart. For
instance, a {@link Mart} consisting entirely of {@link Schema}s from the
same database on the same server being asked to create a mart via a
{@link MartConstructor} which also points to the same database on the
same server would be able to do the transformation directly via DDL
statements, but if any of the data sources are disparate or on a
different server or platform then the only way is to select and insert
data via JDBC. This check is achieved via the {@link DataLink}
interface, and its two subinterfaces {@link JDBCDataLink} and {@link
XMLDataLink}.</p>
