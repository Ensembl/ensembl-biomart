<p>MartBuilder is separated into three components - model,
controller and view.</p>
<p>This package contains the controllers.</p>
<p>The controllers interface between the model and view. Classes
here provide common functions such as loading/saving MartBuilder XML
files, connecting and communicating with data sources, and taking the
trees of actions necessary to build marts and converting them into DDL.</p>
