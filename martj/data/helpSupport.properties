startUp=MartShell: An Interactive User Interface to BioMart databases based on Mart Query Language (MQL) \
        \ntype 'help' for a list of available commands, or type 'help command' to get help for a particular command.
CommandHistoryHelp=\n\n  The Shell provides a command history system allowing you to type the up \
                   \n  arrow key to scroll through previous commands. It saves your history \
                   \n  between sessions. Use the 'history', 'execute', and 'saveToScript' \
                   \n  commands to manipulate your history in other ways \
                   \n  (see help for further details).
CommandCompletionHelp=\n\n  The Shell also provides advanced, context sensitive command completion. \
                      \n  Hitting the tab key once during a command will attempt to complete \
                      \n  what you are typing, or, given multiple possible completions, beep. \
                      \n  Hitting the tab key twice in succession causes the system to display \
                      \n  a list of possible completions available, based on the exact point \
                      \n  you are located in a command (in the case of MQL querries, even across \
                      \n  multiple lines).
COMPLETIONUSAGE=\n  use <tab> <tab> -- Hitting tab twice quickly in succession causes the \
                \n  system to display all available datasets. \
                \n\n  get <tab> <tab> -- same, but only potential attributes for the dataset \
                  \n  set in a use command are displayed. \
                \n\n  using datasetname get att1 where <tab> <tab> -- same, but only potential \
                  \n  filter names for the dataset in the using clause are displayed.\n
